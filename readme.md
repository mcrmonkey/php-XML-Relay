PHP-XML-Relay
=============

Created to overcome a firewalling issue where the final target isn't directly accessable from the sending host but it can be accessed via an intermediary.

Script was designed to operate with XML output from another system.


Requirements
------------

You'll need a machine running PHP and capable of taking a POST containing XML data

The `php5-curl` module will also be required to perform the relay.
